# hrs_sample
Sample Restful API for HRS

## Requirements
Using modern PHP (think PHP7, composer, autoloading, PSR-4, and best practices) please create a "Routing Class" as defined below.

A routing class is designed to take a url segment and automatically invoke a controller class. It does this by breaking up the url segments that come
in a predictable pattern and invoking the correct class and method and inserting parameters into the method invoked. We will be following
a REST-ful convention and be using common http methods. Your Routing class will be aware of the http method and the actual url segment.

Here is the complete requirement. These tables represents all possible routing logic.

### Unnested routes 

| Method | Segment      | Controller class name | Controller method name | Parameters                                                      |
| ------ | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /patients    | PatientsController    | index                  | none                                                            |
| GET    | /patients/2  | PatientsController    | get                    | this should invoke `get($patientId)` where $patientId = 2       |
| POST   | /patients    | PatientsController    | create                 | none (extra credit for handling the request body)               |
| PATCH  | /patients/2  | PatientsController    | update                 | `update($patientId)`                                            |       
| DELETE | /patients/2  | PatientsController    | delete                 | `delete($patientId)`                                            |


### Nested routes

| Method | Segment                    | Controller class name         | Controller method name | Parameters                                  |
|------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /patients/2/metrics        | PatientsMetricsController     | index                  | `index($patientId)`                         |
| GET    | /patients/2/metrics/abc    | PatientsMetricsController     | get                    | `get($patientId, $metricId)`                |
| POST   | /patients/2/metrics        | PatientsMetricsController     | create                 | `create($patientId)`                        |
| PATCH  | /patients/2/metrics/abc    | PatientsMetricsController     | update                 | `update($patientId, $metricId)`             |       
| DELETE | /patients/2/metrics/abc    | PatientsMetricsController     | delete                 | `delete($patientId, $metricId)`             |


### Routes

To invoke the Routing class we'll be calling it statically. For example we'll be defining a `routes.php` that looks like this


```
Route::resource('patients');
Route::resource('patients.metrics');
```

## Features
- **Pure python sample.**  It dosen't need to install other library.  It was built with built-in libaraies that comes with php.
- **Sqlite Database.**  It makes this sample runs without any other database configuration.  It generates sql schema automatically.
- **Phpunit.**  It has phpunit test class.  Also it shows how to use this restful api.

## Things to do
- It dosen't have features like list and count of records with given condition.  These should be in this sample to be a complete sample but it wasn't in the requirements.  
- Routing has basic functionalry and dosen't have tags for parameters like "/patients/&lt;int&gt;/metrics/&lt;string&gt;".  This is much useful to make understand easier and to reduce mistakes.
